Class: Organization of Programming Languages w/ Professor Charles Wilkes
Assignment: A4 Tombstones

What I accomplished: I used templates and operator overloading in order to implement tombstones as described in the provided text.
    My implementationMy implementation passes tests 1-9, but gives a dangling reference exception after the "About to use the free() friend function - beware of SEGFAULTs..." test.
    I was not able to figure out how to get past this error, but overall I was mostly successful in my implementation.

In order to run this program, enter "make" or "make tests" to create an executable and then enter "./tests" to run the tests
