README file for Cameron Knopp OPL Assignment 1
Languages Used: Ada, Haskell, Go, Python, Prolog

Q1: What was easy?
A: I found Go and Python the easiest to understand. Python has a built-in cartesian product function,
    so calculating the cartesian product in Python entails simply calling that function. In addition, Python is just pretty easy to read and understand.
    I found that Go has some definite similarities to C++ and Python, so I was able to understand it's syntax fairly easily. 

Q2: What was hard?
A: I thought that Prolog was the most difficult, followed by Ada. I have never worked with a programming language like Prolog, 
    so it was intuitive for me to understand. I found that Ada was fairly similar to other programming languages I've seen, so I didn't
    think it was THAT difficult to figure out.

Q3: Are there noticeable differences in speed?
A: No

Q4: What do you like/dislike?
A: I liked seeing the similarities between the languages and working in something other than my usual C++ or Python. 
    

Q5: Did you use polymorphism in one or more of your programs? If YES, specify which one(s), 
    and comment on whether it was easy or hard to make use of polymorphism in the respective language(s)
A:
