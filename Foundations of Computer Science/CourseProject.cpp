TASK NOTES:
Task 1: I will be using a std::list to represent an alphabet and I will be using an object to represent a character
Task 2: I will be using an abstract class to represent a string and then I will make child-classes from that class which will allow for the building up of strings out of different elements
Task 3: Still need to complete. Unsure of what exactly it is I am supposed to do, so I am skipping forward to task 4.
  - I think my issue is likely that I just don't fully understand how the character and string classes are going to coursework
  - What are some examples of what the string objects will be holding? Will it be binary, will it be full words, will it be symbols?
Task 4: Unsure of what is meant by representing the set of states as a membership function
  - Confused as to how the data could be held by a function, or does he mean that
  - Need to think about what exactly the DFA class will be capable of doing

  // first sort the strings in lexicographical order, then just return the string at the given position in the list
